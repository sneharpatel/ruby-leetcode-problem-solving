# You are in-charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year
# of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
# Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
#
# For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 3,2,1,3,
# she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candle is of height 3 and there are 2 such candles.
#
# Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles that takes your niece's age and an integer
# array containing height of each candle as input, and return the number of candles she can successfully blow out.
#

#
# We have one candle of height 1 , one candle of height 2 , and two candles of height 3.
# Your niece only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where height = 3 .
# Because there are 2 such candles, we print 2 on a new line.
